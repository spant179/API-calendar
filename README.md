Penn LPS Coding Bootcamp has assigned us with the task of creating a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starte code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. Each timenlock is color coded for past, present, and future. When you type into the text area it saves to local storage on refresh.
